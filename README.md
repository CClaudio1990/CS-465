# CS-465

# Architecture

**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

# Functionality

**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**
    
    * JSON is a data format, not a programming language like JavaScript is. JSON ties the frontend and backend together by being the medium to store and transmit the data between layers. Specifically, JSON is like a universal language spoken by both the front and back ends. The frontend parses the JSON data coning from the backend when it recieves the data it requests.

**Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**

# Testing

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

# Reflection
